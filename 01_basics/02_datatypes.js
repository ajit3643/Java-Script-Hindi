// **************** STACK AND HEAP MEMORY IN JS **************

// Stack (Primitive),  Heap (Non - Primitive)

/*
STACK :- In JavaScript, static data includes primitive values like strings, numbers, boolean, null, and undefined.
A fixed amount of memory is allocated for static data.

HEAP :- It is used to store objects and functions in JavaScript. 
The engine doesnâ€™t allocate a fixed amount of memory.
